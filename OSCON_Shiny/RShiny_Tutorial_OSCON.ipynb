    "==================================\n",
    "\n",
    "What is R Shiny?\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "`Shiny` is an R package that enables you to build interactive web apps\n",
    "using both the statistical power of R and the interactivity of the\n",
    "modern web. An excellent alternative to spreadsheets and printed\n",
    "visualizations, R Shiny saves space and time in constructing and sharing\n",
    "data visualizations and statistical analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "What's in a shiny app?\n",
    "----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "    library(shiny) # start by loading the necessary packages (shiny is always necessary)\n",
    "\n",
    "    ui <- fluidPage( # lay out the UI with a ui object that controls the appearance of our app \n",
    "\n",
    "      )\n",
    "\n",
    "    server <- function(input,output) { # server object contains instructions needed to build the app\n",
    "\n",
    "      }\n",
    "\n",
    "    shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server) # combines ui and server objects to create the Shiny app\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional comments about the UI\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this `fluidPage` layout, the app uses all available browser width,\n",
    "so you, the app developers, don't need to worry about defining relative\n",
    "widths for individual app components. Also, under the hood, `shiny`\n",
    "implements layout features available in Bootstrap 2, a popular HTML/CSS\n",
    "framework, but the nice thing about working with `shiny` is that no\n",
    "HTML, CSS, or even Bootstrap experience is necessary to create\n",
    "informative apps!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional comments about the server\n",
    "\n",
    "The server is generally where all of the calculations, calls, and\n",
    "backend actions take place in a `shiny` app.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question for the Audience!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Which is *not* generally a part of the Shiny app architecture?\n",

    "tutorial, save it as a single file (app.R).\n",
    "\n",
    "You now have a sample R Shiny app to customize and make your own! Notice\n",
    "that the basic anatomy of an R Shiny app is represented here with the\n",

    "===========================================\n",
    "\n",
    "Reactive Flow\n",
    "-------------\n",
    "\n",
    "One familiar way of thinking about the Reactive Flow is in the context\n",
    "of a spreadsheet (e.g. Google Sheets, Microsoft Office Excel).\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you write a value into a cell in a spreadsheet, and in another\n",
    "cell, you write a formula that depends on that cell. First the formula\n",
    "is calculated with the value you originally typed. Then, when you change\n",
    "the value of the original cell, the result of the formula will\n",
    "automatically update, or react, to this change. In a shiny app,\n",
    "reactivity happens in a similar fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our Shiny app that we built in the last session, we have a\n",
    "`selectInput` with the inputID `z`. No matter what the user inputs, the\n",
    "inputID always stores it as `z`, so whenever the user selects a\n",
    "different option from the list, the value of `z` is updated in the input\n",
    "(`input$`) list.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a shiny application, there's no need to explicitly define\n",
    "relationships between inputs and outputs and tell R what to do when each\n",
    "input changes. Shiny's reactivity automatically handles these details\n",
    "for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "UI Inputs\n",
    "---------\n",
    "\n",
    "Referring to the shiny cheatsheet, there are several different types of\n",
    "ui inputs you can place in your shiny app for pretty much any kind of\n",
    "data object you can think of.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Add more UI inputs to our app\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's add an interactive datatable to our app's display, so that we can\n",
    "see the data along with the visualizations!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Best Practice: If you want to add a datatable to your app, make it interactive and sortable by using the `DT` package.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the ui's mainPanel, below the other outputs, add:\n",
    "\n",
    "          DT::dataTableOutput(outputID = \"fireball_table\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the corresponding `DT::renderDataTable({})` to the server:\n",
    "\n",
    "      output$fireball_table <- DT::renderDataTable({\n",
    "          DT::datatable(data = nasa_fireball,\n",
    "                        options = list(pageLength = 10),\n",
    "                        rownames = F)\n",
    "      })\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's also add a `dateRangeInput()` to our app that restricts our\n",
    "visualizations and datatable to only showing data within a user's\n",
    "specified date range. To do this we have to sort and make our original\n",
    "data, `nasa_fireball.rda`, reactive. More on reactivity and its inner\n",
    "workings will be covered later in the tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the `dateRangeInput()` widget as the first widget in the ui, since\n",
    "all other widgets are now depending on the input value in this widget:\n",
    "\n",
    "    #    sidebarPanel(  # commented here for placement\n",
    "          # Date Range Input for data table and plots\n",
    "          dateRangeInput(inputId = \"date_range\",\n",
    "                       label = \"Date Range:\",\n",
    "                       weekstart = 1, \n",
    "                       start = min(nasa_fireball$date), # starts on first date in dataset\n",
    "                       end = max(nasa_fireball$date), # ends on last date in dataset\n",
    "                       startview = \"year\"), # conveniently sort by year first instead of day, since data has a large range of dates\n",
    "\n",
    "In the server, before all outputs, make `nasa_fireball.rda` reactive:\n",
    "\n",
    "      nasa_fireball_reactive <- reactive({    #  Reactive nasa_fireball: uses a cached expression, updates automatically when input changes\n",
    "        nasa_fireball %>%\n",
    "          filter(date >= input$date_range[1] &\n",
    "                   date <= input$date_range[2])\n",
    "      })\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Best Practice: Make the dataset used in your Shiny app reactive to enable the visualizations depending on your dataset to be updated whenever the dataset is updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace `nasa_fireball` in each `output$*` with\n",
    "`nasa_fireball_reactive()`. `nasa_fireball_reactive()` has parentheses\n",
    "at the end, because it is a reactive dataset and is implicitly treated\n",
    "as a no-argument function. (More information about this and reactivity\n",
    "in general will be covered later in the tutorial.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, `output$fireball_table` should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "      output$fireball_table <- DT::renderDataTable({\n",
    "          DT::datatable(data = nasa_fireball_reactive(), # cached expression, only reruns when input changes\n",
    "                        options = list(pageLength = 10),\n",
    "                        rownames = F)\n",
    "      })\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices not applicable in this app, but still good to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice when we delete the date inputs (or any other inputs for that\n",
    "matter) all of the outputs disappear and we don't get an error message,\n",
    "which is nice. Other inputs, when you delete them won't be so nice,\n",
    "though, and will throw an error message, like `numericInput()` for\n",
    "example. That's when you would use the `req()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type `req(input$*)` before any calculation/manipulation in your reactive\n",
    "rendering function in the server, and you won't get an error message\n",
    "anymore, just a nice blank output like we have in our Shiny app.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, say for example you wanted to select more than one input from\n",
    "these lists of variables to sort the datatable. You would go into your\n",
    "`selectInput()` widget and add `multiple = T` as an option, along with\n",
    "adding `req(input$*)` in your reactive `render*()` function in your\n",
    "server.\n",
    "\n",
    "UI Outputs\n",
    "----------\n",
    "\n",
    "Referring to the shiny cheatsheet, there are several different types of\n",
    "ui outputs you can place in your shiny app for pretty much any kind of\n",
    "data object you can think of.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Add more UI outputs to our app\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Best Practice: Always add your session information to make your app more reproducible and easier to troubleshoot.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the ui mainPanel, let's add our session information below all of the\n",
    "other outputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "          # verbatimtextOutput of the sessionInfo\n",
    "          h5(\"My Session Information:\"), verbatimTextOutput(\"sessionInfo\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't forget to add the corresponding `render*()` in the server!\n",
    "\n",
    "     # Session Info\n",
    "      output$sessionInfo <- renderPrint({\n",
    "        capture.output(sessionInfo())\n",
    "      })\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Best Practice: If your data has permission to be public, always make it downloadable in your Shiny app.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the ui mainPanel, immediately below the `DT::dataTableOutput()`, add\n",
    "a `downloadButton()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "          downloadButton(\"download_data\",\"Download\"),\n",
    "\n",
    "Be sure to add the corresponding `downloadHandler()` in the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "      # Download dataset to .csv\n",
    "      output$download_data <- downloadHandler(\n",
    "        filename = \"nasa_fireball.csv\",\n",
    "        content = function(file) {\n",
    "          write.csv(nasa_fireball_reactive(), file, row.names = FALSE)\n",
    "        })\n",
    "\n",
    "The Theory of Reactivity\n",
    "------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Reactivity makes shiny apps more efficient but also more complex. There\n",
    "are three kinds of objects in reactive programming: **reactive sources,\n",
    "conductors, and endpoints.**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Reactive sources** are typically user inputs that come through a\n",
    "    browser interface (`input$*`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Reactive endpoints** are objects that appear in a user's browser\n",
    "    window, such as a plot or table of values (`output$*`). One reactive\n",
    "    source can be connected to multiple endpoints and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Reactive conductors** (`reactive()`) are reactive components\n",
    "    between sources and endpoints. A conductor can be both a child and\n",
    "    parent (both being a dependent and having dependents) whereas a\n",
    "    source can only be a parent (can only have dependents) and an\n",
    "    endpoint can only be a child (can only be a dependent).\n",
    "\n",
    "> We've already made use of these reactive expressions to build our app,\n",
    "> updating the backend dataframe, visualized dataframe, map, ggplot, and\n",
    "> download every time we select a new date range.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question for the Audience!**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `nasa_fireball_reactive()` expression in our app is a...\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Reactive source\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Reactive conductor\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Reactive endpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "By using a reactive expression for the subsetted data frame, we were\n",
    "able to get away with subsetting the data only once, but using it 4\n",
    "times. Reactive conductors, in general, are very nice, because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  You don't have to repeat yourself and have copy-and-paste code, and\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  You can decompose large, complex calculations into smaller pieces to\n",
    "    make them more understandable.\n",
    "\n",
    "These advantages of reactive conductors are similar to those gained by\n",
    "decomposing a large, complex R script into a series of smaller functions\n",
    "that build on each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions vs. Reactives\n",
    "\n",
    "Everytime you call a **function,** R will evaluate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reactive expressions** are lazy, and will only execute when their\n",
    "input changes. Even if you call a **reactive expression** multiple\n",
    "times, it only re-executes when its inputs change.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reactlog\n",
    "\n",
    "Using many reactive expressions in your app can create a complicated\n",
    "dependency structure in your app. The reactlog is a graphical\n",
    "representation of this dependency structure, and it also gives you very\n",
    "detailed information about what's going on under the hood as Shiny goes\n",
    "through and evaluates your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practice: View your reactlog.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a fresh R session, type:\n",
    "\n",
    "    options(shiny.reactlog = TRUE)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then launch your app as you normally would, and press CTRL + F3 in the\n",
    "app to view your reactlog. More information about reactlogs can be found\n",
    "in the [RStudio\n",
    "Documentation](https://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/1.1.0/showReactLog.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Advice from RStudio:** \"For security and performance\n",
    "reasons, do not enable `shiny.reactlog` in production environments. When\n",
    "the option is enabled, it's possible for any user of your app to see at\n",
    "least some of the source code of your reactive expressions and\n",
    "observers.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reactors vs. Observers\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation of reactive sources (e.g. `input$*`):\n",
    "\n",
    "Reactive sources contain many individual reactive values that are set by\n",
    "input from the web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation of reactive conductors (e.g. `reactive()`):\n",
    "\n",
    "Reactive conductors can access reactive values or other reactive\n",
    "expressions, and they return a value. This is useful for caching the\n",
    "results of any procedure that happens in response to user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation of reactive endpoints (e.g. `observe()`, `output$*`):\n",
    "\n",
    "An `output$*` object is an observer. What's going on under the hood is\n",
    "that a render function returns a reactive expression, and when you\n",
    "assign it to an `output$*` value, Shiny automatically creates an\n",
    "observer that uses the reactive expression. Observers can access\n",
    "reactive sources and reactive expressions, but they don't return a\n",
    "value. They are primarily used for their side effects, including sending\n",
    "data to a web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Synopsis of Reactors vs. Observers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Similarities:** Both store expressions that can be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Differences:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Reactive expressions return values, observers don't.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Observers (and endpoints in general) respond to changes in their\n",
    "    dependencies, but reactive expressions (and conductors in general)\n",
    "    do not.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Reactive expressions must not have side effects, while observers are\n",
    "    only useful for their side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Most importantly:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `reactive()` is for calculating values, without side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `observe()` is for performing actions, with side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Do not use `observe()` when calculating a value, and especially\n",
    "    don't use `reactive()` for performing actions with side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question for the Audience!**\n",
    "\n",

    "to RStudio's documentation for more\n",
    "information.](https://rstudio.github.io/shinythemes/)\n",

    "--------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Share Your App with the World!\n",
    "------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've just been running (and hosting) our shiny apps locally. To\n",
    "share them with the world, we need to host them on another server.\n",
    "Here's 3 convenient ways for you to do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Host on shinyapps.io**\n",
    "\n",
    "RStudio provides a service called shinyapps.io which lets you host your\n",
    "apps for free. It is integrated into RStudio so that you can publish\n",
    "your apps with the click of a button, and it has a free version. The\n",
    "free version allows a certain number of apps per user and a certain\n",
    "number of activity on each app, but it should be good enough for just\n",
    "starting out with Shiny. It also lets you see some basic stats about the\n",
    "usage of your app.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hosting your app on shinyapps.io is the easy and recommended way of\n",
    "getting your app online. Go to www.shinyapps.io and sign up for an\n",
    "account. When you're ready to publish your app, click on the \"Publish\n",
    "Application\" button in RStudio and follow their instructions. You might\n",
    "be asked to install a couple packages if it's your first time.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a successful deployment to shinyapps.io, you will be redirected to\n",
    "your app in the browser. You can use that URL to show off to your boss\n",
    "or family and friends what a cool app you wrote.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Host on a Shiny server**\n",
    "\n",
    "The other option for hosting your app is on your own private Shiny\n",
    "server, which is also free. Instead of RStudio hosting the app for you,\n",
    "you'll have it on your own private server. This means you'll have a lot\n",
    "more freedom and flexibility, but it also means you'll need to have a\n",
    "server and be comfortable administering a server. I currently host all\n",
    "my apps on my own Shiny server just because I like having the extra\n",
    "control, but when I first learned about Shiny I used shinyapps.io for\n",
    "several months.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Host on an AWS EC2 Instance**\n",
    "\n",
    "My coworkers and I use this hosting environment at my workplace. It's\n",
    "fast, efficient, and I highly recommend it. Work with your IT department\n",
    "and use the tutorial linked below in \"Additional Resources\" to set this\n",
